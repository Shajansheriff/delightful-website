				<p style="width: 80%">Every single product based company out there believes in the customer-first approach and those keywords are being used strongly on their website, blogs etc. In practice, majority of them miss out on capitalising on the perspectives shared by the customers because of poor documentation and a bad game of Chinese Whisper that happens between the customer to the sales or customer success teams and finally, to Product Management teams. Overall, in a place where they want to give importance to customer first approach is lost because of the lack of best practices that could be followed.
					<br/>
					<br />
					We believe that a solution to this has to be a change from a customer first approach to a perspective first approach, wherein, we weigh in everyone's opinion with the right weightage to take smart and comprehensive decisions.
					<br />
					<br />
					So we are excited to introduce delightful.cx to bring this vision of perspective first approach in project development and growth.</p>
